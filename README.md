# Brownie

## Start with sifting through the Branded food data to gather ingredients.
1. Create Cloud Storage,
1. Create BigQuery table or some other data source that ingests from Cloud Storage,
1. We're using BigQuery because it has on-demand pricing and we aren't doing much querying.

## Where to start...
1. Created GET /foods/search route as a resource so that we can have cohesion between the model and the view. (For example, having a search action under the foods reource requires a completely different model.)
1. System test
1. Validation errors
1. Use Capybara
1. Create View Components?
