# Brownie

## Start with sifting through the Branded food data to gather ingredients.
1. Create Cloud Storage,
1. Create BigQuery table or some other data source that ingests from Cloud Storage,
1. We're using BigQuery because it has on-demand pricing and we aren't doing much querying.



## Where to start...
1. I want to hook up terraform and a CI system,
1. I want to create a materialized view of my list of ingredients and track the ingredients parsing query,
1. I also want to read and work on D&D right?
1. I want to learn Python and Terraform
